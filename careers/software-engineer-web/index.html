<h1 class="has-text-centered">Software Engineer Web</h1>

<p class="has-text-centered">We are looking for a highly motivated and passionate engineer to join us in creating beautiful and engaging user experiences for our product. You will work first hand with user insight, be deeply involved in the design and product development process, and write code to build products that solves real problems.</p>

<h2 id="TL-DR"><a href="#TL-DR" class="headerlink" title="TL;DR"></a>TL;DR</h2><ul>
<li>CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li>Participating in user research and collaborating with interaction designer</li>
<li>Remote friendly</li>
<li>Competitive salaries, stock options and vacation days</li>
<li>No formal education needed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Who-are-we"><a href="#Who-are-we" class="headerlink" title="Who are we?"></a>Who are we?</h2><p>Confrere AS is newly founded by two engineers with extensive experience in building products that people love. Our main focus in previous projects has been building communication services that changes the way people interact. And we are now eager to fix a specific aspect of interaction that we think is still broken.</p>
<p>Have you ever had to travel to your doctor, sit in a waiting room, appointment is delayed, and then you spend only 10 minutes with your doctor? We have as well - the feeling of spending 2 hours of our working time just to see the doctor for 10 minutes leaves us with a feeling that there is a problem to fix. We want to tackle this issue, not only in health, but for all professional services that today require a physical meeting. We wish to abolish travelling time, waiting rooms, complex booking systems and radically simplify and improve the situation for both client and professional. We do this by making software that enables professionals to meet clients online, securely, and without the hassle that usually comes with video conference software.</p>
<h2 id="Who-are-we-looking-for"><a href="#Who-are-we-looking-for" class="headerlink" title="Who are we looking for?"></a>Who are we looking for?</h2><p>You believe that user experience is everything, and you live and breathe to solve peopleâ€™s problems in everything you do. You have experience writing software for the web, specifically for human computer interaction. You write modern CSS and JavaScript, and have experience building complex applications for the web. Your code, like your designs, show that you put people first, and understand that the code you write will be read hundreds of times more than you write it. You are not afraid to go out to actual users to understand their needs and problems, observing and analyzing to improve the product every step of the way.</p>
<p>This role will be working closely with interaction and graphical designers to realize everything from prototypes to complex features on the web, participating in user research, and doing product analytics to analyze the impact of your changes.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s great if you have formal education. But we are also looking for experienced professionals who do not necessarily have the formal education. We are more interested in you being a driven individual thatâ€™s passionate for your work, and willing to challenge yourself to overcome your limitations.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-we-offer-you"><a href="#What-can-we-offer-you" class="headerlink" title="What can we offer you?"></a>What can we offer you?</h2><p>As our first employee, you will have a strong impact on the product from day one, how itâ€™s formed, what problem it solves, and how itâ€™s built. We can offer you diverse and exciting work that range from coding components and experiences on the web to going out to do user research with our pilot users.</p>
<p>We have the usual: competitive salaries, stock options and vacation days. In addition, we build our culture around mutual trust and the freedom to work when and where you are happiest. Because we believe happy employees are productive, engaged and healthy employees. Thatâ€™s why we offer you to work from anywhere you want, whenever you want. You are responsible that you complete the tasks youâ€™ve promised to the best of your ability. Sometimes that means you have to be in the office or observing users, and sometimes it means you can work from Japan, or a cafÃ© downtown. We want to enable you to be the happiest you can be, and deliver the best work that you can do.</p>
<p>Trust also goes beyond your own work. At Confrere, we are all experts, but weâ€™re not experts at everything. Therefore, we trust and respect each others expertise, and we are not afraid to ask questions, or raise issues when we see them.</p>
