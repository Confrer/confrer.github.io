You care about uptime, performance, and building human friendly APIs.</p>
<p>You are pragmatic and can find compromises, but you’ll speak up when you feel something is wrong or could be done better.</p>

This means you’ll have a strong impact on the product from day one, how it’s formed, what problem it solves, and how it’s built.</p>
<h4 id="A-friendly-and-experienced-team"><a href="#A-friendly-and-experienced-team" class="headerlink" title="A friendly and experienced team"></a>A friendly and experienced team</h4><p>Everyone says they’re nice, and we think we are too, of course. (We enjoyed home-made cakes to celebrate this job opening). What’s more, this team is highly experienced within video and product development. </p>
<p>You’ll work closely with Dag-Inge Aas (previously tech lead in <a href="https://appear.in" target="_blank" rel="external">appear.in</a>) and Ingvild Indrebø (previously front end developer at BEKK). Since we’re a small team you’ll also work with our CEO Svein Willassen (co-founder of appear.in) and Ida Aalen (working with user experience since 2009). Check out the articles at <a href="https://shifter.no/appear-in-grunder-svein-willassen-starter-videosamtale-startup-fatt-to-medgrundere/" target="_blank" rel="external">shifter.no</a> and <a href="http://kampanje.com/tech/2017/09/startup-klar-ida-aalen-vil-at-legebesoket-skal-gjores-pa-video/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kampanje</a> to learn more.</p>

Sometimes that means being in the office or observing users, and sometimes it means you work from Japan, or a café downtown.</p>

<p>We’ve interviewed dozens of doctors, psychologists, tutors, advisors and many others, who believe that video consultation has a role to play for their profession. Several of them has already signed up to be pilot users this fall.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us, so that we can make sure they’ll get the experience they deserve. </p>
